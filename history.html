                          The land of Shanghai was a part of Huating County in the Tang dynasty, but a village called Shanghai Pha was established in the south of the Suzhou River, and it became known as Shanghai Town in the Song dynasty. On the other hand, there was also a Xiahai Temple near the current Hongkou District in the lower reaches of the Huangpo River.
